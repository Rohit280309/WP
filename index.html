        <h2>INS Vikramaditya and Aircraft Carrier Debate </h2>
        <h5>INS Vikramaditya (Sanskrit: Vikramāditya, lit. "Brave as the Sun")
          is a modified Kiev-class aircraft carrier and the flagship of the Indian Navy, which entered into service in
          2013</h5>
        <center><img src="assets/img/history.jpeg" width="500"> </center>
        <p>Baku entered service in 1987, and was renamed Admiral Gorshkov in 1991, but was deactivated in 1996 because
          she
          was too expensive to operate on a post-Cold War budget. This attracted the attention of India, which was
          looking
          for a way to expand its carrier aviation capabilities <br>
          The deal also included the purchase of 12 single-seat Mikoyan MiG-29K 'Fulcrum-D' (Product 9.41) and four
          dual-seat MiG-29KUB aircraft (with an option for 14 more aircraft) at US$1 billion, six Kamov Ka-31 "Helix"
          reconnaissance and anti-submarine helicopters, torpedo tubes, missile systems and artillery units. Facilities
          and procedures for training pilots and technical staff, delivery of simulators, spare parts, and establishment
          maintenance on Indian Navy facilities were also part of the contract.<br>

          The upgrade involved stripping all the weaponry and missile launcher tubes from the ship's foredeck to make
          way
          for a "short take-off but arrested recovery" (STOBAR) configuration,[31] converting the Gorshkov from a hybrid
          carrier/cruiser to a pure carrier. The announced delivery date for INS Vikramaditya was August 2008, which
          would
          allow the carrier to enter service just as the Indian Navy's only light carrier INS Viraat retired. While
          Viraat's retirement had been pushed out to 2010–2012,[32] it underwent a final refit which enabled her to
          serve
          through 2016.[33]<br>

          The issue with the delays was compounded by ongoing cost overruns, leading to high-level diplomatic exchanges.
          India finally agreed to pay an additional US$1.2 billion for the project, doubling the original cost.[34]
          However, ongoing difficulty with the Vikramaditya's delivery schedule, pushed the expect delivery to 2013.
          Also,
          the indigenous Vikrant-class aircraft carrier was delayed by at least a year and was expected to be
          commissioned
          in 2013 from the proposed 2012<br></p>

        <h2>Structural modifications</h2>
        <h5> Vikramaditya has a larger full load displacement than when the ship was originally launched in 1982 as Baku
        </h5>
        <centre><img src="assets/img/ins-vikramadityahistory.jpg" width="500"></centre>
        <p> The major modifications were to allow Admiral Gorshkov to operate as a STOBAR aircraft carrier in Indian
          service, as opposed to the STOVL configuration the ship was built as. This involved removal of all the
          armament,
          including the P-500 Bazalt cruise missile launchers and the four Antey Kinzhal surface-to-air missile bins
          fitted on ship's bow, to make way for a 14.3°, full-width ski-jump. The 20-ton capacity aircraft lift beside
          the
          ship's island superstructure was unchanged, but the aft lift was enlarged and its lift capacity increased to
          30
          tons. For STOBAR operations, three 30 m arrestor wires and three restraining gears on the stern of the angled
          deck were fitted. Sponsons were installed to increase the area of the flight deck, to allow the ski-jump to be
          fitted, for strengthening of arresting gear and runway area, and to lengthen the after end, which allowed an
          increase to the length of the landing strip aft of the arresting gear. 234 new hull sections were installed to
          achieve the desired shape, and the total steel added to carry out these modifications amounted to 2500
          tons.<br>

          The superstructure profile was designed to accommodate the fixed phased array scanners of the Soviet Navy's
          Mars-Passat 3D air search radar system, along with extensive command and control facilities to conduct an
          aerial
          campaign. Extensive revamp of sensors was carried out, with long range air-surveillance radars and advanced
          electronic warfare suites fitted, which enable the maintenance of a surveillance bubble of over 500 km around
          the ship. An aft mast was installed to accommodate various communication antennae. These changes needed 2,300
          km
          of new cables, and 3,000 km of new pipes.<br>

          The eight original boilers were replaced by new generation, high-pressure boilers, converted to take diesel
          fuel
          utilising LSHSD instead of furnace fuel oil, each providing a steam capacity of 100 tonnes per hour. The new
          boilers are highly efficient and have high levels of automation. They power four propellers in four shaft
          configuration, producing a total thrust of 180,000 horsepower (134,226 kW) at the shaft, providing a top speed
          of over 30 knots. Six turbo alternators and six diesel alternators generate 18 MW of electricity to power
          various equipment. Modern oil-water separators as well as a sewage treatment plant were incorporated to meet
          international standards. Six new Finnish Wärtsilä 1.5 MW diesel generators, a Global Marine communications
          system, Sperry Bridgemaster navigation radar, a new telephone exchange, new data link and an IFF Mk XI system
          were added. Hotel services were improved with the addition of two reverse osmosis plants producing 400 tons of
          fresh water per day, as well as updated refrigeration and air conditioning. A new galley was installed
          together
          with improved domestic services and accommodation for 10 female officers</p>
